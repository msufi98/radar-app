I am creating a radar viewing application to view nexrad 2 radars. I using the https://registry.opendata.aws/noaa-nexrad/ to access the retrpospective radar data from an S3 bucket. this data is stored by date time and radar. An explanation of this data storage format is given here:
https://github.com/awslabs/open-data-docs/blob/main/docs/noaa/noaa-nexrad/README.md
I want to create a web app that can access this data to show a list of radars, give options to select a radar location and a date time, then access and convert the aws data to a netcdf format and then parse and display the data.
the final radar displayed should look something like the images on this site:
https://hydroinformatics.uiowa.edu/project_info.php?project=level2
The limiations we are working with is mainly the tech stack. We unfortunately do not have a backend and will have to create a simple javascript app when working with this project. we can usejavascript libraries on the frontend to actually build this out.

Now I want you to start with a simple web interface. for web design prioiritise minimalism and professionalism over funky displays. The first page should be a place where you can select 1. The radar and 2. the date time. Once we select that we will show a second page where we will show a map interface with zoom, elevation and azimuth selecction interface.


Currently start with the first page. First fetch all available sites:
https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/nexradinv/choosesite.jsp
(I can copy paste the list for you too if you want)
Show the radars on a Google Maps interface over the US, that a person can select. leave a placeholder for google maps key i will put that in. This interface should be on the left hand side of the screen. On the right hand side of the screen show a calendar interface that users can use to select a date time. Once they select the year, month and day, use the aws s3 ls command to see if the radar data for that day exists maybe using something like this: aws s3 ls s3://noaa-nexrad-level2/2019/05/06/ --no-sign-request
If it does not exist, show an error message that data for this site for this date time does not exist. If the user goes the other way around and selects the dates first, then filter the radar pins on the google map interface. Build the pins using AdvancedMarketElement in Google. 
Once both are selected, below the date, display a selection of available times for user selection.

Do this and then we will go to the next step. If you are stuck on a single step for a long time especially around terminal commands or online search, let me know and I will do them manually for you
